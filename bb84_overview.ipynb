    "##  The Rise of Network Dependence and the Need for Secure Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, our society will become increasingly reliant on networks. Information and communication networks (hereafter referred to simply as *networks*) have become indispensable in our daily lives. For example, the processing of electronic payments via credit cards or e-money is all performed over these networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more appliancesâ€”like smart TVs, air conditioners, and vacuum cleanersâ€”are becoming network-enabled. Even in industries such as manufacturing and agriculture, sensors are now used to collect real-time data to enhance quality and productivity.\n",

    "This growing interconnectivity signifies that society will depend even more heavily on network infrastructure in the years to come.\n",

    "\n",
    "##  Why Communication Security is Crucial\n",
    "\n",
    "These networks transmit sensitive information about individuals, corporations, and even governments. To prevent this data from being leaked or misused, it is encrypted. Modern encryption algorithms rely on complex mathematical problems that are currently infeasible to break with today's classical computers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Quantum computers, with their unprecedented computational power, are poised to revolutionize fields from medicine to logistics. However, this same power poses a serious threat to classical cryptographic systems. Problems that would take classical computers thousands of years to solve could potentially be cracked within minutes by quantum computers.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a response to the looming threat of quantum attacks, **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** has emerged as a promising cryptographic technology. QKD allows two parties to share encryption keys in a way that is fundamentally secureâ€”guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical cryptography (which sends keys through encrypted algorithms over the internet), QKD transmits keys via **photons** over optical fibers. Because of quantum principles like the **no-cloning theorem** and **measurement disturbance**, QKD can detect any eavesdropping attempt, ensu\n",

    "###  Step 4: Error Detection & Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in ideal conditions, **noise** or potential **eavesdropping** can cause discrepancies between Alice and Bobâ€™s sifted keys. To ensure they end up with identical keys, they perform two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Error Detection (QBER Estimation)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alice and Bob randomly select a small subset of the sifted key and **publicly compare** those bits.\n",
    "- This allows them to compute the **Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{QBER} = \\frac{\\text{Number of mismatches}}{\\text{Number of test bits}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- If QBER exceeds a predefined threshold (commonly **11%** in BB84), it indicates a possible eavesdropping attempt, and the protocol is **aborted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”§ Error Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "- If QBER is acceptable, Alice and Bob perform **error correction** to reconcile their remaining sifted key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is done via **classical error correction protocols** over a **public authenticated channel**. Common techniques include:\n",
    "  - **Cascade protocol** (interactive, iterative parity-check-based)\n",
    "  - **LDPC codes** (Low-Density Parity-Check)\n",
    "  - **Winnow**, **Hamming**, or **Turbo codes** in some implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Simulation Note\n",
    "\n",
    "In our BB84 simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume **perfect error correction** with a correction **efficiency factor** (e.g., 0.8), which models how many bits are lost during correction.\n",
    "- Only a fraction of the sifted key survives after this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If sifted key length = 1000 bits and correction efficiency = 0.8,  \n",
    "then final key after correction â‰ˆ **800 bits**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Error correction must reveal **only minimal information** to Eve. Thatâ€™s why this step is followed by **privacy amplification**, which removes any residual leak.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " **Summary**:  \n",
    "Error correction ensures that Alice and Bob end up with **identical keys**, despite noise or tampering. The trade-off is that a portion of the key is consumed to guarantee this alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Step 5: Privacy Amplification\n",
    "\n",
    "To eliminate any partial information that an eavesdropper (Eve) might have gained during transmission, Alice and Bob perform **privacy amplification** â€” a process that compresses their shared key into a shorter, **secret** key that is provably secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Why Privacy Amplification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after error correction, Eve might still possess partial knowledge about the raw key due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detector noise  \n",
    "- Multi-photon pulses (vulnerable to photon-number-splitting attacks)  \n",
    "- Side-channel leaks  \n",
    "- Active interception attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy amplification ensures that **any such knowledge becomes useless**, by reducing the key length in a mathematically safe way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Methods of Privacy Amplification\n",
    "\n",
    "- In our **simulation**, we used a **simple XOR-based method**, where adjacent bits are combined:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:  \n",
    "  Original bits: `[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`  \n",
    "  Amplified: `[1âŠ•0, 1âŠ•1, 0âŠ•0, 1âŠ•1] = [1, 0, 0, 0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is a basic and illustrative method that mimics how entropy is compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **real QKD systems**, more sophisticated techniques are used, such as:\n",
    "  - **Universal hashing functions** (e.g., Toeplitz matrices)\n",
    "  - **Random extractors** from complexity theory\n",
    "  - **Hash-based protocols** proven to be secure under the **Leftover Hash Lemma**\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods provide **information-theoretic security**, meaning the final key remains secure **even against adversaries with unlimited computational power**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  How Final Key Length Is Determined\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **length of the final key** after privacy amplification depends on:\n",
    "  - The **estimated knowledge Eve might have** (from QBER and other parameters)\n",
    "  - The **error correction efficiency**\n",
    "  - The **confidence level** in the security proof (usually chosen by the protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In general:\n",
    "  - **Lower QBER â†’ longer final key**\n",
    "  - **Higher noise or detected eavesdropping â†’ shorter final key**\n",
    "  - The protocol always ensures that **the leftover key is safe**, regardless of compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " **Bottom line**: Privacy amplification shrinks the key just enough to erase any trace of Eveâ€™s potential knowledge â€” leaving Alice and Bob with a smaller, but truly secure, shared secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Eavesdropping Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "If an **eavesdropper (Eve)** intercepts and resends the qubits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- She **does not know** Aliceâ€™s basis choices.\n",
    "- Measuring the qubit will collapse its state.\n",
    "- When Eve sends a new qubit to Bob, it may not match Aliceâ€™s original encoding.\n",
    "- This increases the **Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher-than-expected QBER reveals **eavesdropping** activity, prompting Alice and Bob to abort the protocol or run **error correction and privacy amplification** steps.\n",
