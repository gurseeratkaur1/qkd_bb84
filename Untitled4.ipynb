    "\n",
    "In the future, our society will become increasingly reliant on networks. Information and communication networks (hereafter referred to simply as *networks*) have become indispensable in our daily lives. For example, the processing of electronic payments via credit cards or e-money is all performed over these networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more appliances‚Äîlike smart TVs, air conditioners, and vacuum cleaners‚Äîare becoming network-enabled. Even in industries such as manufacturing and agriculture, sensors are now used to collect real-time data to enhance quality and productivity.\n",

    "## üîê Why Communication Security is Crucial\n",
    "\n",
    "These networks transmit sensitive information about individuals, corporations, and even governments. To prevent this data from being leaked or misused, it is encrypted. Modern encryption algorithms rely on complex mathematical problems that are currently infeasible to break with today's classical computers.\n",

    "Quantum computers, with their unprecedented computational power, are poised to revolutionize fields from medicine to logistics. However, this same power poses a serious threat to classical cryptographic systems. Problems that would take classical computers thousands of years to solve could potentially be cracked within minutes by quantum computers.\n",

    "As a response to the looming threat of quantum attacks, **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** has emerged as a promising cryptographic technology. QKD allows two parties to share encryption keys in a way that is fundamentally secure‚Äîguaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical cryptography (which sends keys through encrypted algorithms over the internet), QKD transmits keys via **photons** over optical fibers. Because of quantum principles like the **no-cloning theorem** and **measurement disturbance**, QKD can detect any eavesdropping attempt, ensu\n",
